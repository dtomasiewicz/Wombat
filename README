This is actually 4 separate packages-- the client application (wclient), the server application (wserver), shared client-server resources (wshared), and the communication protocol (wproto). When the project gets larger, these components will be separated into separate repos.

Since there is no installer, modules will need to be manually placed somewhere in Python's search path.

All packages require Python 3. If Python 3 is your environment's default Python implementation, you can execute server.py and client.py directly in bash. If not, you will need to specify the python3 interpreter:

Example:
  $ python3 server.py

To run the server, run server.py with the name of the configuration file you wish to use.

Example:
  $ ./server.py server.cfg

The configuration file must contain valid connection information for a postgresql database instance.

To run a command-line client (default), just execute client.py.

Example:
  $ ./client.py

To run a graphical client, pass in the -g flag.

Example:
  $ ./client.py -g
