This is actually 3 separate packages-- the client application (client), the server application (server), and the communication protocol (wombat). When the project gets larger, these components will be separated into separate repos.

To get it to work without changes to your PATH (or the source files themselves), symlink the protocol package in both the client and server directories.

$ cd server
$ ln -s ../wombat wombat
$ cd ../client
$ ln -s ../wombat wombat

All packages require Python 3. If Python 3 is your environment's default Python implementation, you can execute server.py and client.py directly in bash. If not, you will need to specify the python3 interpreter:

Example:

$ python3 server.py
