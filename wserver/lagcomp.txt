Lag Compensation

2 players A, B are in combat against each other. Player begins to cast a 3 sec
spell. In the first scenario (S1), the cast completes successfully. In the other
scenario (S2), player B attempts to interrupt the cast 2 seconds after they are 
notified of it.

For each scenario, we look at four cases:
  Ideal: both players experience no latency (LAN or same machine)
    RTTa = RTTb = 0
  Typical: both players experiencing normal latency
    RTTa = RTTb = .15
  CastLag: caster has unusually high latency
    RTTa = .5, RTTb = .15
  IntLag: interrupter has unusually high latency
    RTTa = .15, RTTb = .5
  Extreme: both caster and interrupter have unusually high latency
    RTTa = RTTb = .5
  
  Optimization for cases follows this priority:
    1. Typical (most important)
    2. IntLag = CastLag
    3. Extreme (least important)
    4. Ideal (insignificant)

Scenario 1: B does not attempt interrupt

  RTTa/2           Server receives cast message, sends notification to B   0     .075    .25     .075   .25
