Server Threading Models:

At any time:
  N connected clients
  I idle clients
  0 <= I <= N

All models assume a minimum 2 threads for the client listener and notifier.

Thread-Per-Connection
  Threads: 2 + N
    2 + N blocking threads
  D: idle clients waste server resources

Select (spawning new thread on client action)
  Threads: 2 + N - I + 1 (selector)
    3 blocking threads
  A: minimal overhead for idle clients (still checked by selector obviously)
  D: non-idle clients must wait to be selected again for subsequent actions
    Fix: At end of thread execution, perform non-blocking recv on client socket
