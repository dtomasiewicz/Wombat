Shared Resources

 - client notify connection (client._notify). total control of this stream by
   the _nlisten thread is relinquished once it is added to _anstreams, when it
   becomes a shared resource. once it is received by a user, it will only be
   handled by client.sendnotify, HOWEVER multiple threads may call sendnotify
   on a specific client at once.

Non-shared resources worth noting:

 - client objects. total control of these objects is handed from _clisten to 
   client.act threads once they are placed in server.clients. mutation of 
   client objects (claimnotify, disconnect) is, from then on, handled by 
   client.act, and server.idle ensures only a single client.act can run at once
   
 - client control connection (client._control) is only processed by client.act,
   and server.idle ensures that only a single client.act can be running at once
   for a specific client
